Meeting with Jonathan Eisen, Heather Bischel, Courtney Mattson, and Sam Díaz-Muñoz on JGI-SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Monitoring
May 24, 2021

-Jonathan: The weird history of this joint JGI/UCD grant. Kate Lane.

-qPCR: Extracts throughout the year

-First step: sequence analysis workflows that are in existence for variant calling. Go beyond variants. Assemble genomes from wastewater or link variants in distance sites.

-The data is a panel of PCR primers that have small PCR primers (100-150bp). Smaller amplicons better for wastewater. Swift.

-Deconvolution workflow

-Data from patients, asymptomatic testing. Genotype data for most all positives

-2 sample sets sequenced from WW samples collection

-Wastewater samples correspond to areas within the city. Or building sampling on campus.

-Two ways to get sequenced through HDT, asking JGI may be possible. 

Existing Wastewater Sequencing Results:
-10-12 of different WW samples (with ARTIC primers) from Sam’s lab
-Raw and iBar pipeline. 24 samples (WWTP, lowest Ct results). From UCD SOM (data in Dropbox/Box)


Next Steps / Overall Rough Goals
1. Figure out bioinformatic processing of samples, variant calling pipeline, and variant determination from existing UCD WW samples
2. Test extraction methods with sequencing from heather’s lab
3. Decide on ideal samples to sequence, questions to answer, data available.
4. Get those selected sampled sequenced.
5. Run through pipeline and analyze
6. Separate paper or hop onto Heather’s existing planned projects.
